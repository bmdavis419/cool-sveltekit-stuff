## SvelteKit Example App

This is a simple little demo using SvelteKit, TailwindCSS, SkeletonUI, the Bun runtime, and Docker.

### Running the app

To run the app, make sure you have Bun installed, then run `bun install` to install the dependencies. Then run `bun run dev` to start the dev server.

### Deploying the app

You can deploy this app almost anywhere, although I recommend using [Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/docs) for fast, easy, cheap, and global deployments using docker.
